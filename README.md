# GIM-subdivision-schemes
Create simulations of GIM schemes in Matlab
There are three main classes of data: SPD, SE, SO. Two algorithm: 4pt-scheme and cubic B-spline.

The main subdivision file is "GIM_Subdivision".
To run example of SE data and the 4pt-scheme use (under "tests" folder) "test_GIM_4pt_SE_matrices".
To run example of SO data and the cubic B-spline scheme use (under "tests" folder) "test_GIM_CubicBspline_refinement".
To run either algorithm with SPD data use (under "tests" folder) "test_GIM_4pt_positive_matrices". 
The file "test_GIM_element_wise" is to run the algorithm for scalars/vectors.
